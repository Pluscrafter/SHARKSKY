                      ##### FLASH peripheral features #####
==============================================================================
         
[..] The Flash memory interface manages CPU AHB I-Code and D-Code accesses 
     to the Flash memory. It implements the erase and program Flash memory operations 
     and the read and write protection mechanisms.
    
[..] The Flash memory interface accelerates code execution with a system of instruction
     prefetch and cache lines. 

[..] The FLASH main features are:
    (+) Flash memory read operations
    (+) Flash memory program/erase operations
    (+) Read / write protections
    (+) Prefetch on I-Code
    (+) 64 cache lines of 128 bits on I-Code
    (+) 8 cache lines of 128 bits on D-Code
    
                   ##### How to use this driver #####
==============================================================================
  [..]                             
    This driver provides functions and macros to configure and program the FLASH 
    memory of all STM32F7xx devices.
  
    (#) FLASH Memory IO Programming functions: 
         (++) Lock and Unlock the FLASH interface using HAL_FLASH_Unlock() and 
              HAL_FLASH_Lock() functions
         (++) Program functions: byte, half word, word and double word
         (++) There Two modes of programming :
          (+++) Polling mode using HAL_FLASH_Program() function
          (+++) Interrupt mode using HAL_FLASH_Program_IT() function
  
    (#) Interrupts and flags management functions : 
         (++) Handle FLASH interrupts by calling HAL_FLASH_IRQHandler()
         (++) Wait for last FLASH operation according to its status
         (++) Get error flag status by calling HAL_SetErrorCode()          
  [..] 
    In addition to these functions, this driver includes a set of macros allowing
    to handle the following operations:
     (+) Set the latency
     (+) Enable/Disable the prefetch buffer
     (+) Enable/Disable the Instruction cache and the Data cache
     (+) Reset the Instruction cache and the Data cache
     (+) Enable/Disable the FLASH interrupts
     (+) Monitor the FLASH flags status
  [..]     
  (@) For any Flash memory program operation (erase or program), the CPU clock frequency
      (HCLK) must be at least 1MHz. 
  (@) The contents of the Flash memory are not guaranteed if a device reset occurs during 
      a Flash memory operation.
  (@) Any attempt to read the Flash memory while it is being written or erased, causes the 
      bus to stall. Read operations are processed correctly once the program operation has 
    completed. This means that code or data fetches cannot be performed while a write/erase 
    operation is ongoing.\end{DoxyVerb}
